Welcome to the Advanced Cloud Development Course! This repository serves as your first step into the world of Python programming. As future cloud computing professionals and machine learning enthusiasts, mastering Python is a crucial skill. This repository is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to excel in Python programming.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on advanced concepts in cloud computing, machine learning, and database systems, with an emphasis on practical applications in these areas. Python, due to its versatility and simplicity, is the chosen language for our journey.

### Key Topics:
- Python Basics: Syntax, Variables, and Data Types
- Control Structures: Loops and Conditionals
- Functions and Modules
- Exception Handling
- File Operations
- Basic Machine Learning Concepts
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Interaction with Cloud Services using Python
- API-Understanding

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking [this repository](https://github.com/exponentialR/AdvancedCLoudDev.git) to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to work on the exercises and projects independently.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to start working on the assignments.

   ```bash
   git clone <your-forked-repo-url>

3. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.8 or newer.

## Classworks
Throughout this course, you will be given classworks, which are practical exercises designed to reinforce the concepts taught in lectures. These exercises are crucial for your understanding and mastery of the course material.

- Access Classworks: The classworks can be found here. Each classwork has its own directory within this repository.

- Submission: Upon completion, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
## API-Understanding
For the API section of this module, you will need to create a python environment.
``python3 -m venv learning-api`` # you can name it whatever you want
After creating the Python virtual environment, activate it by 
``source learning-api/bin/activate``

## Collaboration and Contribution
- Pull Requests: You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers. If you have improvements or additions to the classworks, create a pull request to the main repository.

```
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
git commit -m "Add your message here"
git push origin <feature-branch>
```
- Merging: Pull requests will be reviewed, and if suitable, they will be merged into the main repository. This is a great way to contribute to the learning process of the entire class.
